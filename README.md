## Background

We will create the start of ReproCanAtlas with Endometrial Cancer. This project will integrate single cell RNASeq,  bulk transcriptomics, and genomic data of reproductive/gynecological cancers in order to develop an atlas or knowledge base of those cancers and identify reproductive cancer signatures and therapeutic targets. We will use TCGA via recount3, TissueNexus, COSMIC, DGIdb, and CellMinerCDB. Lastly, we will integrate our findings into an interactive shiny app.

## Data

Data will be accessed through TCGA for Whole Exome Sequencing and bulk RNAseq. Single Cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) will be from paper(s). 

## Usage

The atlas can be used for preliminary analysis by noncomputational groups as well as for clinicians. 

### Installation

Goal is to have a shiny app so it is easy to use and doesn't require further downloads/ programs 

Installation simply requires fetching the source code. Following are required:


### Requirements
To Be determined/ edited as the Hackathon progresses 

## Results
:exclamation: _If your project yielded or intends to yield some novel analysis, please include them in your readme. It can be named something other than results as well._ :exclamation:
